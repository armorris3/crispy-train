                    <p>The goal of this project was to explore the relationship between two variables and tell a compelling visual story. Here I identified how location factors into higher education attainment and marriage among younger women. The data analysis and bivariate map were done in ArcGIS Pro and the compilation of other information was done in Illustrator.</p>

                    <p>When tasked to create a route for a cycling race, I chose to set the scene in the beautiful Pacific Northwest and Canada. While I've only visited the region once, it made an impact. The hillshade and terrain rendering were done in ArcGIS Pro, while aesthetic adjustments were made in Photoshop and Illustrator. </p>
